# Notion Calendar for Linux (Electron App)

This project provides an unofficial desktop application for Notion Calendar on Linux. I created this to have a secure and native-like experience for my daily planning, separate from the browser. The app uses the official Notion Calendar web client, ensuring a safe and reliable experience.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Secure**: Wraps the official Notion Calendar web app, keeping your data safe and sound.
* **Native-like Experience**: Works as a standalone desktop application, making it feel more integrated with your Linux environment.
* **Lightweight**: Focused on performance, providing a smooth user experience without unnecessary features.
* **Customizable**: Built with Electron Forge, allowing for easy customization of app name and icon.

## üöÄ How to Install

Follow these steps to install the Notion Calendar Electron app on your Debian/Ubuntu-based system:

1.  **Download the latest `.deb` package**:
    Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/notyorch/Notion-Calendar-for-Linux/releases) section of this repository and download the most recent `.deb` file.

2.  **Open your terminal**:
    Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the `.deb` file (e.g., `cd ~/Downloads`).

3.  **Install the application**:
    Use `dpkg` to install the package, and `apt-get -f install` to resolve any missing dependencies.

    sudo apt-get install -f
    ```
